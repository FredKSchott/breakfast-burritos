### The Good

The price includes a heaping helping of a side, plus fruit. I enjoyed the country potatoes more than the burrito.

### The Bad

It was quite burned, both the eggs and tortilla on the inside. I like chorizo, but I think it's an odd choice for an only choice at a joint like Black Bear Diner.
