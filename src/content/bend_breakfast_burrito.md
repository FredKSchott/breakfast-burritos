You'd hope a place called "Bend Breakfast Burrito" would make a killer breakfast burrito. Good news: they do. I like how the burrito stuffing is so _equalized_, almost like they make a huge casserole of burrito guts and inject it into the tortilla. It's on the small size compared to other local places, but it feels just right. I find both the red and green salsas they make lackluster but the avocado crema excellent.
