### The Good

You'd hope a place called "Bend Breakfast Burrito" would make a killer breakfast burrito. Good news: they do. I like how the burrito stuffing is so _equalized_, almost like they make a huge casserole of burrito guts and inject it into the tortilla. Get the delicious avocado crema, it's much better than the (unfortunately lackluster) salsas that come with it. Otherwise it begs for Cholula.

They have their own delivery service where you can pick time and day, and do catering as well.

### The Bad

It's on the small size compared to other local places. The hours were pretty weird and random for a while and it still feels like they are figuring that out. But having a steady cart at The Grove in NWX is nice, which delivers some consistency.
